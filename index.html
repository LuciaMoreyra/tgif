                            </h2>
                            <p>Openness, accountability, and honesty define government transparency. In a free society,
                                transparency
                                is
                                government's obligation to share information with citizens. It is at the heart of how
                                citizens
                                hold
                                their
                                public officials accountable. Here at TGIF we believe that government should be
                                transparent.</p>
                            <p>Governments exist to serve the people. Information on how officials conduct the public
                                business
                                and
                                spend
                                taxpayer money must be readily available and easily understood. This transparency allows
                                good
                                and
                                just
                                governance. Transparency promotes accountability and provides information for citizens
                                about
                                what
                                their
                                Government is doing.</p>
                            <p>We also believe that government should be participatory. Public engagement enhances the
                                Government's
                                effectiveness and improves the quality of its decisions. Knowledge is widely dispersed
                                in
                                society,
                                and
                                public officials benefit from having access to that dispersed knowledge. We invite you
                                to use
                                our

                            <h2> Background History of Government Transparency</h2>
                            <p>In the West, the idea that government should be open to public scrutiny and susceptible
                                to public
                                opinion
                                dates back at least to the time of the Enlightenment, when many philosophes made an
                                attack on
                                absolutist
                                doctrine of state secrecy, a core part of their intellectual project. The passage of
                                formal
                                legislative
                                instruments to this end can also be traced to this time with Sweden, for example, (which
                                then
                                included
                                Finland as a Swedish-governed territory) enacting free press legislation as part of its
                                constitution
                                (Freedom of the Press Act, 1766). This approach, and that of the philosophes more
                                broadly, is
                                strongly
                                related to recent historiography on the eighteenth-century public sphere.

                                <p>Influenced by Enlightenment thought, the revolutions in America (1776) and France
                                    (1789),
                                    freedom
                                    of
                                    the
                                    press enshrined provisions and requirements for public budgetary accounting and
                                    freedom of
                                    the
                                    press
                                    in
                                    constitutional articles. In the nineteenth century, attempts by Metternichean
                                    statesmen to
                                    row
                                    back
                                    on
                                    these measures were vigorously opposed by a number of eminent liberal politicians
                                    and
                                    writers,
                                    Bentham,
                                    Mill and Acton prominent among the latter.</p>

                                <p>Open government is widely seen to be a key hallmark of contemporary democratic
                                    practice and
                                    is
                                    often
                                    linked to the passing of freedom of information legislation. Scandinavian countries

                                    adopted the first freedom of information legislation, dating the origins of its
                                    modern
                                    provisions to
                                    the
                                    eighteenth century and Finland continuing the presumption of openness after gaining
                                    independence
                                    in
                                    1917, passing its Act on Publicity of Official Documents in 1951 (superseded by new
                                    legislation
                                    in
